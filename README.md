# Dotfiles
a collection of dotfiles for use on my systems

## INSTALLATION
For convenience, an installation script which automatically creates the config directories and copies the files to their correct locations is included. To quickly install the dotfiles:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/xelphif/dotfiles
$ cd dotfiles/
$ ./install.sh
```
